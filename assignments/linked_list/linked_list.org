* Project 2 Link lists

* Due: TBD


* Folder and files

- Create a folder under your assignment repo named *linked_list*
  and place all files there.

- This project will be built up as a series of smaller
  assignments. Make sure to complete each part as assigned.

* Part 1 - Due 2/24 before class

** Watch these three videos:
- https://youtu.be/mSQjWDAQx-o
- https://youtu.be/Nj-hc0LvYjU
- https://youtu.be/XRGqxNdNLAE

** Add the code for a basic linked list it should include:
- Node.h and Node.cpp as specified in the third video
- List.h and List.cpp as specified in the third video
- A main.cpp that can create a sample list
- A Makefile that will build an executable named *main*.


Try to build a small list and experiment with the data structure

** Try to add the three routines specified in the video:
1. locate
2. remove
3. A destructor

We will go over these in class.

** IMPORTANT NOTE

For this part of the assignment it is important go upload your best
attempt before class. This part will *not* be graded for correctness
but rather for attempt. It doesn't have to work (for now) but the
attempt must be there.


* Part 2 and beyond

When additional parts are added they will be announced on Zulip
