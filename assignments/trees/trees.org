* Project 6 Trees

* Due: See individual parts 


* Folder and files

- Create a folder under assignments named *trees* 
  and place all files there.

- This project requires:
  - A Makefile
  - Doctest based tests
  - At least three targets in the Makefile
    1. main (program executable)
    2. tests (doctest tests executable)
    3. clean (remove the .o files) 
  - You should start with either the code from classcode or your own
    equivalent.
    
* Important notes
1. As indiciated above, you should test your project using doctest
2. Make sure to use exceptions as we discussed in class to handle error conditions.


* Part 1 - Due Monday 5/2 before class 

- Write a recursive version of the search routine. You can write
  additional routines so that you can add parameters. That is, you'll
  probably have the public function ~int rsearch(int value)~ and also
  another one that the first one calls: ~int rsearch(int value, Node
  *p)~.
- Try to write a recursive version of insert. This will not be graded
  if you don't finish it but give it a try.
- Generate 10 random numbers and then insert them into a BST using the
  algorithm we designed. Draw out what that tree looks like. You don't
  have to submit anything for this. 
   


* Part 2 - TBD
